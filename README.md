This repository acts as a journal that documents my journey through Software Engineering. It would be an interesting collection of the books I read, courses I take, websites I traverse and the projects I build along the way.

# Always Be Learning

Lifelong Learning. This is my growth plan for the year 2020. I would be commiting a few hours every night to achieve this. ðŸ¤·ðŸ’™
